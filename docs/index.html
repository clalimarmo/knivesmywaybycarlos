          <p>
            Gardening knife in 1095.
            I use this like a tiny sword to chop the heads off of weeds.
            (It's as fun as it sounds).
            More practically, I use it for pruning back thorny things
            when I go camping.

          <img src="./img/sample/X2/1.jpg" />
          <p>
            Hunting knife in 1084. I don't hunt, but my uncle does sometimes.
            This is a prototype of the knife I'll eventually give him.

          <h3>#001 - Not for Sale</h3>

          <p>
            Work knife, "Model K", in 1095.
            By now it's seen a year or two chopping up boxes and who-knows-what-else in the
            back room of a local grocery store.

          <p>
            Chef/slicer hybrid in 1095. It's been well loved, by the time this picture was taken.

        <h2 id="carlos">About Carlos</h2>

        <p>
          Since his father first showed him how to sharpen knives
          on a whetstone&mdash;over 8 years ago&mdash;Carlos has been practicing hand sharpening.
          In that time,
          Carlos's sharpening technique has been heavily influenced by
          <a href="https://cartercutlery.com">Murray Carter</a> of Carter Cutlery, and
          <a href="https://www.korin.com/vincent-knife-sharpener">Vincent Kazuhito Lau</a>, of Korin.
          Many thanks to both of them for sharing on youtube!
        </p>

        <p>
          Carlos's first experience making knives was
          in 2016,
          in a chef's knife making class
          taught by John Shea at
          the <a href="https://stationnorthtoollibrary.org">Station North Tool Library</a>.
          Carlos's buddy Chris knew well about Carlos's obsession with sharpening knives,
          and suggested they take the knife making class together.
        </p>

        <p>
          The methods and techniques Carlos uses
          inherit heavily
          from those passed on by John
          in that class.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since 2017
          Carlos has been teaching students to make knives at the tool library,
          passing on the tradition and knowledge
          that John bestowed upon him.

        <h2 id="my-way">About <em>My Way</em></h2>

        <p>
          I strive to produce knives
          that are,
          above all else,
          delightful-to-use cutting tools.
          I strive to help students do the same.
        </p>

        <p>
          The process I use for my knives
          is informed by my experience and desires as a teacher.
          For my students, I want the process to be accessible,
          but I want them to create knives that will
          cut the hell out of whatever they plan on cutting,
          and last a damn long time.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the three years I've been helping people
          create knives of their own,
          I've refined the process
          I teach,
          which I inherited from John,
          to balance
          the performance, simplicity, and durability
          of the knives the students produce.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I make knives,
          I combine the practicality and elegance
          of that process
          with the accumulated experience
          from 4 years of knifemaking and teaching.
        </p>

        <p>
          (And watching youtube.
          (And reading a lot of posts about heat treating in the knifemaker's section on
          <a href="https://bladeforums.com/categories/general-knife-makers-discussion.806/">bladeforums.com</a>.
          (And all the pages those posts link to.
          (And reading a lot of industrial literature about heat treating processes.))))

        <p>
          I specialize in blades made from high carbon steel (1095, or 1084).
          I buy steel for my blades from Aldo at
          <a href="https://newjerseysteelbaron.com">New Jersey Steel Baron</a>.

        <p>
          I made this website:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>to inform you about the knives I make (some of which I may be selling, and which you may buy)</li>
          <li>as a joke about the internet, and the industry of making websites</li>
          <li>to make me, personally, laugh</li>
          <li>beside two sleeping dogs. One of them just farted and, as I write this to you, I am breathing in powerful fart smells.</li>
